# excel-price-correction-with-chart
This Python project uses the **openpyxl** library to automate Excel tasks.
It reads price values from an Excel file, applies a **10% discount**, and writes the updated prices into a new column.
The program also generates a **bar chart** based on the corrected prices.
Finally, the updated data is saved into a new Excel file for easy analysis.
